This is a new project called Linked list.

Introduction:
Linked lists are a type of data strucutre similar to arrays. They are made up of nodes that store variables of any datatype and pointers to other nodes in the list. They are of 2 variations: singly linked and doubly linked list

Singly linked list: contain the variable and a pointer to the next node since these nodes are not arranged in contigious blocks of memories like arrays are.

Doubly linked list contain the variable, a pointer to the previous node and a pointer to the next node.

goodluck with your tasks in this project
